5) write the algorithm for ternary search? 
Step 1: Divide the search space in three parts. 
Step 2: The target element is compared with the edge elements that is elements at location mid1, mid2 and the end of the search space. If element matches, go to 
step 3 else predict in which section the target element lies. The search space is reduced to 1/3rd. If the element is not in the list, go to 
step 4 or to step 1. 
Step 3: Element found. Return index and exit. 
Step 4: Element not found. Exit.
